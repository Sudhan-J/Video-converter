# Video-converter
This is a python GUI program that converts any file format to mp4 format.

## Reason
  Couple of months ago I had a project where I had to record the project and  send it to lecturer now to the recordings were in the mkv format so I searched online there were some but with the limited trials that day I thought of some custom software that would do any video not just mkv format so, I started this project, have to admit this was one of the difficult one to solve I could have just wrote the bare bone code that would just do it but it would only help me, I wanted this to be available in public so anyone with the python interpreter can use it, so here it is.

I will update the instructions soon :)
